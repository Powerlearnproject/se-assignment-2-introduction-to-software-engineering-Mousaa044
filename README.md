# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices.We can as well say Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.






Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) include
Requirements
According to Sommerville (2024),this phase involves identifying the needs, goals, and constraints of the software, often through interviews, surveys, and observation. Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements is part of the necessary requirements.

Design
According to Pressman & Maxim (2024), the design phase consists of creating high level and  detailed designs of the software's architecture and components consisting of user interface.

Implementation
According to Pressman & Maxim (2024), during this phase, the software through writng of codes is developed or built according to the plan and design specifications.

Testing
According to Sommerville (2024),the testing phase ensures that various tests are carried out so that the software meets its requirements,quality standards and functional requirements ensuring the software functions correctly.

Deployment
According to Pressman & Maxim (2024),following successful testing, the software is deployed into the production environment.This involves releasing the software to users or customers.

Maintenance
According to Sommerville (2024), maintenance phase involves provision of ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to the  enhancements to the software after deployment in order to  ensure the software remains functional and relevant.





Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile
According to Beck et al., (2024), Agile involves iterative development, continuous client input, flexibility,collaboration, and responding to change.It is useful for large and complex projects and allows for changes at any stage.

Waterfall
According to Royce, (2024), a linear, sequential approach with client input only after each phase. It is used for small projects with well-defined requirements and requires larger teams. 

Key Differences Between Agile and Waterfall Models
a)	Agile Project Management	
•	Client input is required throughout product development.	
•	Changes can be made at any stage.
•	It is really useful in large and complex projects.
•	The testing part can be started before the development of the entire product.	
•	A Small team is sufficient for Agile project management.	
•	The cost of development is less.	
•	It completes the project in comparatively less time. 
•	The Agile Method is known for its flexibility.
•	After each sprint/cycle test plan is discussed.	

b)	Waterfall Project Management 
•	Client input is required only after completing each phase.
•	Changes cannot be made after the completion of a phase. 
•	It is mainly used for small project development.	
•	Testing can only be performed when the complete product is ready. 
•	It requires a large team.
•	The cost of development is high.
•	It takes more time compared to Agile.
•	The waterfall Method is a structured software development methodology so it is quite rigid. 
•	Hardly any test plan is discussed during a cycle.



Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

•	Elicitation
According to Sommerville (2024), in this stage, the requirements are gathered from various stakeholders such as customers, users, and domain experts. The aim is to identify the features and functionalities that the software system should provide.

•	Analysis
According to Sommerville (2024), in this stage, the requirements are analyzed to determine their feasibility, consistency, and completeness. The aim is to identify any conflicts or contradictions in the requirements and resolve them.

•	Specification
According to Pressman & Maxim (2024), in this stage, the requirements are documented in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. The aim is to provide a detailed description of the requirements that can be understood by all stakeholders.

•	Validation
According to Sommerville (2024), In this stage, the requirements are reviewed and validated to ensure that they meet the needs of all stakeholders. The aim is to ensure the requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent.

•	Management
According to Pressman & Maxim (2024), In this stage, the requirements are managed throughout the software development lifecycle. The aim is to ensure that any changes or updates to the requirements are properly documented and communicated to all stakeholders.

Importance of Requirements Engineering in the Software Development Lifecycle
•	It helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders and users.
•	Properly defined and managed requirements serve as a foundation for the design and development of the system.
•	It helps to reduce costs and improve the quality of the final product by identifying any ambiguities or inconsistencies early on in the development process.
•	It also aids in the testing and maintenance of the system and in the communication between the development team and stakeholders.
•	It helps to identify any potential risks or challenges that may arise during the development process.




Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?












Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?






Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.





Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?





Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
